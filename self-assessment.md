# Automate

### Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document

Not yet - But I am working on finishing my Quarto document!

### The analysis runs without errors

Met! - when running each line of code in the analysis, nothing pops up with an error.

### The analysis produces the expected output

Not yet - I have not finished creating the ggplot yet.

### Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)

Met! - my individual script for importing and cleaning is within the root of my project

# Organize

### Raw data is contained in its own folder

Met! - all raw data is within the "data" folder by itself.

### Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

Met! - (1) the intermediate data frame outputs are saved in the "outputs" folder, (2) moving average function is in the "R"" folder, (3) the processing R script is labled as "2" located in the root folder.

### At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file

Met! All my scripts are refactored and made pretty with tons of comments to make sure the reader (aka I) understand everything that I am doing in each code chunk.

# Document

### The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

Not yet! I am still trying to figure out the difference between all 4 of those and where would be the best placement for the scripts.

### The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works

Not yet! I have not created a flowchart yet.

### The code is appropriately commented

Met! all my code is well commented!

### Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention

Met! All the names follow their function

# Scale

### Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

Met! In the "1_import_clean_data" file, there is a list that has all the packages needed to run the repo

### The analysis script runs without errors

Met! I have no errors within my analysis code

# Collaborate
