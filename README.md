# Reproducing a Time Series Plot

## Chemical fluxes within the Puerto Rico's Luquillo Experimental Forest watershed before and after Hurricane Hugo

### Purpose

The project aims to reproduce the time series plot from Dr. Douglas's research, which examines chemical concentrations in the Luquillo Experimental Forest's watersheds following Hurricane Hugo (Schaefer, McDowell, Scatena, and Asbury 2000) .

### Flowchart

The project's workflow is displayed in a flowchart to provide a clear representation of the sequential processes involved.
