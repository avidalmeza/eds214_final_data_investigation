# Peer Assessment 

## Automate - *Not yet*
### **Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document**
Not quite, waiting on a few sections

### The analysis runs without errors
- Yes it does!!

### **The analysis produces the expected output**
- No figure quite yet, any day now I'm sure!

### **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**
- Data cleaning is still within paper.qmd (though it is duplicated within 2_process_moving_avg.R)



## Organize - *Not yet*
### Raw data is contained in its own folder
### Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data
Intermediate data seems to be in "outputs"? 

### **At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file** 
yes! very nice!



## Document - *Not yet*
### The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs
I am mostly seeing the analysis laid out at the moment, few words, but the vision is there

### **The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**
Waiting on the text, coming soon though no doubt

### **The code is appropriately commented**
Im seeing some nice commenting! [Some of it](2_process_moving_avg.R) is a little confusing though..


### **Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention**
I thinks so!



## Scale
### Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages
Don't see one but I'm happy to add one for you! It's E Z P Z
### The analysis script runs without errors
